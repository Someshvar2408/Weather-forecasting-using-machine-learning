# Weather Monitoring System Using Deep Learning

This project leverages IoT devices, Raspberry Pi, BMP 180 sensor, and an LDR to monitor environmental factors. Data from these sensors is uploaded to ThingSpeak and downloaded as a CSV file to train a deep learning model. The goal is to predict faulty sensor values, detect inaccuracies, and identify sensors requiring replacement.

## Introduction

Accurate environmental monitoring is critical in various applications, but sensors can become faulty over time due to wear and tear. This project addresses this issue by using deep learning models to detect faulty sensor readings and ensure sensor reliability.

---

## System Overview

The system integrates:
- **IoT Devices**: Collect environmental data (temperature, pressure, light intensity).
- **ThingSpeak Cloud**: Serves as a platform to store and retrieve sensor data.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Predict and identify sensor faults.
- **CSV Dataset**: Facilitates training and evaluation of the models.

### Hardware Components
- **Raspberry Pi**: Central processing unit.
- **BMP 180 Sensor**: Measures temperature and pressure.
- **LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)**: Measures light intensity.

---

## Dataset

The dataset is a time-series feed exported from ThingSpeak in CSV format. It contains three primary fields:
- `field1`: Light Intensity
- `field2`: Temperature
- `field3`: Pressure

Ensure the dataset file is named `feeds.csv` and stored in the working directory.

---

## Dependencies

Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

---

## File Structure

- **Dataset**: `feeds.csv` (exported from ThingSpeak)
- **Python Script**: Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

---

## Code Description

### Data Loading

The CSV file is loaded using Pandas:
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('/feeds.csv')
```

### Data Splitting

The data is divided into training and testing sets:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X = df.drop(['field1', 'field2', 'field3'], axis=1)
y_temperature = df['field2']
y_pressure = df['field3']
y_light_intensity = df['field1']
X_train, X_test, y_temperature_train, y_temperature_test, y_pressure_train, y_pressure_test, y_light_intensity_train, y_light_intensity_test = train_test_split(
    X, y_temperature, y_pressure, y_light_intensity, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
```

### Model Training

Three separate linear regression models are trained for each variable:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Temperature Model
temperature_model = LinearRegression()
temperature_model.fit(X_train, y_temperature_train)

# Pressure Model
pressure_model = LinearRegression()
pressure_model.fit(X_train, y_pressure_train)

# Light Intensity Model
light_intensity_model = LinearRegression()
light_intensity_model.fit(X_train, y_light_intensity_train)
```

### Predictions and Evaluation

The models are evaluated using Mean Squared Error:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

y_temperature_pred = temperature_model.predict(X_test)
y_pressure_pred = pressure_model.predict(X_test)
y_light_intensity_pred = light_intensity_model.predict(X_test)

mse_temperature = mean_squared_error(y_temperature_test, y_temperature_pred)
mse_pressure = mean_squared_error(y_pressure_test, y_pressure_pred)
mse_light_intensity = mean_squared_error(y_light_intensity_test, y_light_intensity_pred)

print('Mean Squared Error - Temperature:', mse_temperature)
print('Mean Squared Error - Pressure:', mse_pressure)
print('Mean Squared Error - Light Intensity:', mse_light_intensity)
```

---

## Model Training and Evaluation

The system uses a deep learning model to predict environmental factors such as temperature, pressure, and light intensity. The model identifies faulty sensor values by detecting anomalies between predicted and actual readings.

The training process includes:
1. **Data Normalization**: Ensures all features are scaled appropriately.
2. **Deep Learning Model**: A neural network with hidden layers designed to capture patterns in the data.
3. **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used for optimization.
4. **Evaluation Metric**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is used to evaluate the model's performance.

---

## Results

After training the model, the performance is evaluated, and the results are summarized below:

- **Temperature**: `<mae_temperature>` MAE
- **Pressure**: `<mae_pressure>` MAE
- **Light Intensity**: `<mae_light_intensity>` MAE

> Note: Replace the placeholders with actual values after running the code.

The results highlight the system's ability to detect faulty sensors by comparing predicted and actual sensor values. Significant deviations indicate potential sensor issues.

## Usage

To use this weather monitoring system:
1. Collect real-time data using the IoT setup (Raspberry Pi, BMP 180 sensor, and LDR).
2. Upload the data to ThingSpeak and export it as a CSV file named `feeds.csv`.
3. Place the CSV file in the working directory of the Python script.
4. Run the script to train the model and evaluate its performance.
5. Review the output for Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess the accuracy of predictions and identify faulty sensors.
